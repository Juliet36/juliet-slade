      <p><span class="section-details-1">SARAH LAWRENCE COLLEGE</span> | <span class="section-details-2">DATABASES AND SERVER-SIDE PROGRAMMING</span>
      <p><span class="section-details-3">Fall 2016</span></p>
      <p>This was a part of my conference work for Databases/Server-Side Programming. After looking into
        graph databases and neo4j, I researched quad trees. Quad trees are a data structure for storing
        and querying spatial data. Each node is either a leaf or has exactly four children which are the
        four quadrants into which the space is split.
      <br>
      <br>
      Points represent data, and each node has a set limit of points that can be contained
      in it. If an added point exceeds the limit, the node splits into four quadrants.
      <br>
      <br>
      A large advantage of quad trees is seen in the neighbor-finding algorithm. The first
      is "Fast Neighbor" which recursively searches only the nodes that could have a neighbor
      to the given point. The second, "Slow Neighbor," is the non-quad tree version of doing
      this. It examines every point, keeping track of the current closest point.
      <br>
      <br>
      In the visualizer, I have the neighbor algorithm run 200 times behind the scene to
      calculate the average time it takes to complete. Then, it runs once more to visualize.
      The faster algorithm shades the nodes that are checked and marks the options for closest
      point in orange. The average speed is 0.00009 seconds, and it is clear that only a small
      portion of the space is traversed. The slow algorithm checks all of the points, marking
      them in purple, and marks those that were "closest" at one point in orange. The average
      time is 0.065 seconds and it takes a noticeably long time to get through the 200.</p>
