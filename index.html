        Hi, I'm Juliet Slade and this is my first "real" website.
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm from Saint Paul, Minnesota and have been living in New York since 2013 when I entered
        Sarah Lawrence College with no idea what I would study. I quickly found computer science,
        and spent the rest of my time there working through all of the CS classes offered.
        This brought me to take classes on interpreting and compiling PLs, artificial
        intelligence, databases, computer architecture, quantum computing, and physical computing.
        Also, in a true liberal arts fashion, I integrated these with classes in which I made books,
        wrote nonfiction, studied printmaking, and learned 3D modeling.
        <br>
        <br>
        Through my time at Sarah Lawrence I worked as a lab assistant and tutor, doing which I
        found that I love helping people learn to program and answering questions. It both
        solidified my own knowledge and pushed me to learn more. I also found that I enjoy
        figuring out how to build things and helping people realize their projects. I have little
        trouble getting too invested in and obsessed with every interesting challenge that
        comes my way.
