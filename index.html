        <br>
        Hi, I'm Juliet Slade.
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm from Saint Paul, Minnesota and have been living in New York since 2013 when I entered Sarah
        Lawrence College. One of my first classes was in Computer Science, and four months later I would find
        myself in an airport, waiting for my flight home for winter break, writing a howLongUntilTakeoff()
        function in Python. This is to say: I became obsessed. I spent the rest of my time there working
        through all of the CS classes offered at Sarah Lawrence. These included classes on interpreting and
        compiling PLs, neural networks and genetic algorithms, databases, computer architecture, quantum
        computing, and physical computing. Because of Sarah Lawrence's unique conference system and minimal course requirements, I not only got to
        delve deeper into these subjects through semester-long research projects of my choosing, but I could
        combined these with my other interests in courses in which I made books, wrote nonfiction, studied
        printmaking, and learned 3D modeling. Outside of the classroom, I found time to rock climb and play with
        the tennis team (MVP three years and Captain!).
        <br>
        <br>
        Additionally, while at Sarah Lawrence I worked as a lab assistant and tutor. I found that I am good
        at and passionate about helping people learn to program and to realize their own projects. Every time I
        meet with someone, be it for a tutoring session or brainstorming with a friend, I
        feel fulfilled and inspired, and I'm always ready for another project that I can devote my time and
        creative energy to.
